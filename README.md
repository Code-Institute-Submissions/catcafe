# Milestone Project 1 – Cat Cafe

My project is for a fictional cat café. It contains a homepage, gallery, menu page, contact page and FAQ. The website is a static website, primarily using HTML and CSS with the help of other frameworks such as Bootstrap to build it. The aim of the website is to attract customers to the café, providing easy navigation through the site and information for users to see.

## UX
 The website is for cat lovers and for customers who would like to enjoy a drink or food while being able to interact with cats. For them to be able to see which cats are at the café, to see menu options and provide information to the customers about the cafe such as opening times, location etc. In terms of business, the aim of the website is to attract customers and spread the idea of visiting a cat As a user, I want a gallery of the cats with names/descriptions of cats to see which cats are in the café.

### Wireframes 
For my wireframes, I used the Balsamiq Wireframes programme to create them. The wireframes were valuable as they allowed me to gain an idea of what the website was to look like before building it. It also allowed me to discuss the design of the website with my mentor, prior to starting my project. A few changes were made in this discuss – customer reviews were added via a carousel on the homepage, basic contact information was added to the footer and a map was added to the Contact page. A few changes were made on the final website but the design is overall similar to the wireframes and the idea of the cat café still remains. 
###Design
For the design, initially I was aiming to go for a very slick, elegant look however, after some constructive criticism, I was advised that the site looked dull as the main colors used were greys and creams/browns. After this, I decided to change some of the colors used to make the site brighter and look more appealing/fun. 
###Font
I used Google Fonts to choose my fonts. The main two fonts used were ‘Playfair Display’ with a backup of sans-serif, and ‘Raleway’, with a backup of serif. ‘Playfair Display’ was mainly used for headings, logos and titles while ‘Raleway’ was used primarily for other text on the website such as for customer reviews, contact form and descriptions of the cats on the gallery page. 
###Colors
I used hex codes for my choice of colors to be able to select more precise colors. The initial color scheme was as follows – 
#4F3B38
#C9C180
#E5E1D8
#9C6F69
These colors were taken from Instagram.com however after using the colors on the actual website, they appeared differently to those on Instagram. #9C6F69 was more of a purple color and I was aiming for an orangey-brown. The revised colors for the final website are ADD COLORS FROM FINAL VERSION HERE.



## Features
### Existing Features
### Logo 
The aim of the logo is to attract the user, and give immediate idea of what the website is promoting. The image for the logo was chosen as it is a cat, and the way the tail is curled and the body of the cat almost looks like the handle and main container of a mug. The cat image was used from https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1303003/screenshots/3988327/cat-logo.png and edited by myself in accordance to the website’s theme. 
### Navbar
The aim of the navbar is to navigate the website and to be able to visit the different pages with ease. 
-There are five links in the navbar which link to the - 
-Homepage
-Meet the cats (gallery)
-Menu
-Contact page
-FAQ
-The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu when resized to the tablet and mobile viewports.
### Footer
The footer of the website contains the following information - 
-Opening times

It allows the user to gain basic information about the café so they can plan their trip or directly contact the café.

### Features Left to Implement

I would like to implement an online store where you can buy needed items for the cats via the cat café website. 
I would like to add a live stream of the café to users so they can see the café and view the cats playing during opening hours. 

## Technologies Used




[HTML]  To enable the basic building on the website.
[CSS] for styling the website. 
[Bootstrap 4]  For structure and for responsiveness when viewing on different devices. 
[MD Bootstrap] For styling and responsiveness.
[Github] A remote location and where I can publish my website to host. 
[Gitpod]  My preferred IDE for building the website. 
[Git] for version control. 
[Google fonts]  to choose and use different fonts for the website. 
[Font Awesome]  For different icon elements used. 
[JS, jquery, Popper.js]  To use alongside Bootstrap for creating certain parts of the website such as the hamburger icon. 



## Testing
-W3C Mark-up Validation – This was used for checking html cold for validity and to ensure there were no errors in the html code. 
- W3C CSS Validation – This was used for checking errors in the CSS code. 
-I had initial problems with the logo and hamburger menu. They were not responsive to different viewports and the dropdown for the menu had too much padding, making the links drop further below the navbar. By removing extra padding in the CSS this made the dropdown links fit on the navbar instead of falling below. 

### User Story tests
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
