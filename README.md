# Milestone Project 1 – Cat Cafe

My project is for a fictional cat café. It contains a homepage, gallery, menu page, contact page and FAQ. The website is a static website, primarily using HTML and CSS with the help of other frameworks such as Bootstrap to build it. The aim of the website is to attract customers to the café, providing easy navigation through the site and information for users to see.

 The website is for cat lovers and for customers who would like to enjoy a drink or food while being able to interact with cats. For them to be able to see which cats are at the café, to see menu options and provide information to the customers about the cafe such as opening times, location etc. In terms of business, the aim of the website is to attract customers and spread the idea of visiting a cat As a user, I want a gallery of the cats with names/descriptions of cats to see which cats are in the café.

### Wireframes 
For my wireframes, I used the [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) programme to create them. The wireframes were valuable as they allowed me to gain an idea of what the website was to look like before building it. It also allowed me to discuss the design of the website with my mentor, prior to starting my project. A few changes were made in this discuss – customer reviews were added via a carousel on the homepage, basic contact information was added to the footer and a map was added to the Contact page. A few changes were made on the final website but the design is overall similar to the wireframes and the idea of the cat café still remains.

### Design
For the design, initially I was aiming to go for a very slick, elegant look however, after some constructive criticism, I was advised that the site looked dull as the main colors used were greys and creams/browns. After this, I decided to change some of the colors used to make the site brighter and look more appealing/fun. 
### Font
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to choose my fonts. The main two fonts used were ‘Playfair Display’ with a backup of sans-serif, and ‘Raleway’, with a backup of serif. ‘Playfair Display’ was mainly used for headings, logos and titles while ‘Raleway’ was used primarily for other text on the website such as for customer reviews, contact form and descriptions of the cats on the gallery page. 
### Colors
I used hex codes for my choice of colors to be able to select more precise colors. The initial color scheme was as follows – 
#4F3B38
#C9C180
#E5E1D8
#9C6F69
These colors were taken from [Instagram](https://instagram.com) however after using the colors on the actual website, they appeared differently to those on Instagram. #9C6F69 was more of a purple color and I was aiming for an orangey-brown. The revised colors for the final website are #E7E7E7, #3C3130 and #D4AF37.



## Features
### Existing Features
### Logo 
The aim of the logo is to attract the user, and give immediate idea of what the website is promoting. The image for the logo was chosen as it is a cat, and the way the tail is curled and the body of the cat almost looks like the handle and main container of a mug. The cat image was used from [Dribble](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1303003/screenshots/3988327/cat-logo.png) and edited by myself in accordance to the website’s theme. 
### Navbar
The aim of the navbar is to navigate the website and to be able to visit the different pages with ease. There are five links in the navbar which link to the


- Homepage
- Meet the cats (gallery)
- Menu
- Contact page
- FAQ


The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu when resized to the tablet and mobile viewports.


### Footer
The footer of the website contains the following information


- Opening times
- Contact information
- Social media links


It allows the user to gain basic information about the cafe so they can plan their trip or directly contact the cafe. 

### Info section
The homepage contains an info section, giving brief details about the cafe. Who the company are and what they do. It also contains reasons to visit the café. This allows the user to get an overview of the café and see if they would like to visit. 
### Carousel
The homepage contains a carousel, containing customer reviews of the cafe. There are 3 slides, containing images with text over them of customer reviews. 
### Gallery
There is a gallery section, allowing users to view the cats present at the cafe. There are also names and descriptions of the cats, when an image in the gallery is hovered over with the mouse.
### Menu
The menu section contains names, short descriptions and prices of the food and drinks available at the cafe. 
### Contact us form
There is a contact form on the Contact page, allowing the user to send messages. The different types of messages possible to send are booking requests, questions, general comments or complaints. 
### Map
There is a map embedded in the Contact page, to allow the user to plan their trip ahead of time. 
### FAQ 
The FAQ section gives an overview of rules to follow when visiting. 

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to implement an online store where you can buy needed items for the cats via the cat café website. 
- I would like to add a live stream of the café to users so they can see the café and view the cats playing during opening hours. 

## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)  To enable the basic building on the website.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) for styling the website. 
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  For structure and for responsiveness when viewing on different devices. 
- [MD Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) For styling and responsiveness.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) A remote location and where I can publish my website to host. 
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)  My preferred IDE for building the website. 
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) for version control. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  to choose and use different fonts for the website. 
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  For different icon elements used. 
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) To use alongside Bootstrap for creating certain parts of the website such as the hamburger icon. 



## Testing
- [W3C Mark-up Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) This was used for checking html cold for validity and to ensure there were no errors in the html code. 
- [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). This was used for checking errors in the CSS code. 

- [This link](https://i.imgur.com/hGnzN0F.jpg) shows how the html for my website is valid.
- [This image](https://i.imgur.com/GduNbbQ.jpg) shows the CSS for my website is valid.



- I had initial problems with the logo and hamburger menu. They were not responsive to different viewports and the dropdown for the menu had too much padding, making the links drop further below the navbar. By removing extra padding in the CSS this made the dropdown links fit on the navbar instead of falling below. 
- Navbar dropdown list items were dropping below the navbar height on mobile and tablet viewports. Resolved by adjusting the padding for list items.
- Lot of whitespace in smaller viewports between the hero image and readytobook. Bug fixed by applying background-position-y.
- Home link showing as active item on all pages. Resolved by adding 'active' to the correct files, corresponding to which page is being viewed.
- Unspecific classes were creating bugs on different pages - made more specific classes fixed these bugs.
- Kittens.jpg image was not responding to smaller viewports. Resolved by using an img src instead of using the image as a background class, and the class img-fluid.
- Vertical line from middle of navbar to bottom was showing. Resolved by removing the original logo image and turning it into a brand within the navbar.
- Dropdown list for menu was showing on left side of screen. Moved to right side as wanted by using the flex class in Bootstrap.
- A bug was accidentally created by using a 'center' class, to center the text on the readytobook image. Images in the gallery were half cropped due to this. Resolved by changing the center class name to center-book.

### User Story Tests

The features were tested on multiple browsers and devices to check if the features were appealing as well as responsive.
